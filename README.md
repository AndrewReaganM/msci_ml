## Time-series data cleaning by predicting missing data values

### Description:
We provide publicy available Equity closing price and fundamental data for some period of history. We will also provide a corrupted dataset with missing values scattered throughout the feed. The ask is that for a given day, the model can predict any missing information from some portion of the set, the inputs must be variable. The target is primarily a deep network infrastructure capable of inferring a price from descriptive information and other prices, secondarily also capable of interring missing descriptive info. 

### Branch: Melissa
This includes some notebooks for some data cleaning and small scale training for the cleaned dataset. This also includes a library with some helper functions for the project. 

### Status
- [x] Cleaned a subset of the data
- [x] Small training pipelibe
- [x] Base case code
- [ ] Fully fleshed out training pipeline for all tickers
- [ ] Pipeline for training on corrupted datasets

### TODOs
TODO(mewilson): finished committing code to clean the dataset

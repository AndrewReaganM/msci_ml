## Time-series data cleaning by predicting missing data values

### Description:
We provide publicy available Equity closing price and fundamental data for some period of history. We will also provide a corrupted dataset with missing values scattered throughout the feed. The ask is that for a given day, the model can predict any missing information from some portion of the set, the inputs must be variable. The target is primarily a deep network infrastructure capable of inferring a price from descriptive information and other prices, secondarily also capable of interring missing descriptive info.

# Time Series Data Cleaning by Predicting Missing Data Values
The objective of this project is to predict data values that are missing from
a stock dataset using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Asset Structure
The files in this project are organized in the following structure:

### src/preparation
This directory contains the data import code that is used to pull the dataset
from disk into memory.

### src/processing
This directory contains the data processing code that prepares the data for use
with machine learning models. This code will likely be used after the code in
`src/preparation` is used to pull the data from disk.

### data/raw
This diretory contains the raw data imported from the source.

### data/processed
This directory contains intermediary pre-processed data.
